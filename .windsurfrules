## Core Operating Principles

### 1. Interpret Instructions Accurately
- Read all instructions carefully.
- Ask for clarification if anything is unclear.
- Identify constraints and technical requirements precisely.
- Never assume or exceed task scope.

### 2. Execute and Validate Rigorously
- Perform file and code operations in complete, optimized sequences.
- Continuously check output for correctness and quality.
- Resolve issues with focused, relevant solutions.
- Do not add features or content beyond what is explicitly requested.

### 3. Report and Confirm Clearly
- Report implementation progress regularly.
- Confirm decisions at key points.
- Flag blockers early with resolution suggestions.

## Project Context & Standards

### 1. Project Overview
- Name: secure_qr_scanner Website
- Objective: Marketing website and privacy policy pages for the QR Scanner app
- Framework: SolidStart (SolidJS with SSR) + TailwindCSS v4
- Design: Purple gradient theme matching the Flutter app
- Purpose: App landing page, privacy policy, terms of service (required for Google Play)

### 2. Code Standards
- Use SolidJS reactive primitives (createSignal, createEffect, etc.)
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Follow SolidStart file-based routing conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Optimize for SEO and fast page loads
- Prefer server-side rendering where appropriate
- Use TailwindCSS v4 utility classes for styling
- Follow the purple gradient design system from app.css

### 3. Design System
- **Purple Gradient Colors:**
  - Primary: #8B5CF6 (violet-500)
  - Secondary: #D946EF (fuchsia-500)
  - Accent: #7C3AED (violet-600)
  - Additional: #A78BFA (violet-400), #E879F9 (fuchsia-400), #C084FC (purple-400)

- **Typography:**
  - Font: Inter (system-ui fallback)
  - Consistent with Flutter app design

- **Theme Support:**
  - Respect `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
  - Provide light and dark mode variants
  - Use CSS custom properties from app.css

### 4. File Structure
- `src/routes/` → Page components (file-based routing)
- `src/components/` → Reusable UI components
- `src/styles/` → Global styles (app.css)
- `public/` → Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)

### 5. SEO & Performance
- Add proper meta tags (title, description, OG tags)
- Optimize images and assets
- Use semantic HTML
- Ensure fast Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Add structured data where appropriate

### 6. Content Requirements
- Privacy Policy page (required for Google Play)
- Terms of Service page
- App landing/home page
- Clear, user-friendly language
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

### 7. Quality Standards
- No TypeScript errors
- No console warnings in production
- Test on multiple browsers
- Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop
- Ensure proper SSR hydration
- Check accessibility with screen readers

---

## Task Execution Workflow

### 1. Analyze
- Identify core functional goals and confirm scope
- Ensure alignment with SolidStart and TailwindCSS v4
- Review existing components before creating new ones
- Consider SEO and performance implications

### 2. Implement
- Build pages with proper routing structure
- Create reusable components
- Apply consistent styling using TailwindCSS
- Ensure responsive design
- Add proper meta tags and SEO elements

### 3. Test
- Test in both light and dark modes
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Check SSR functionality
- Validate HTML and accessibility
- Test page load performance

### 4. Final Review
- Ensure all required pages are present and functional
- Validate SEO meta tags
- Confirm clean console (no errors/warnings)
- Review against scope: no extra or missing features
- Verify mobile responsiveness

## Common Patterns to Follow

### SolidJS Component Pattern
```tsx
import { Component, createSignal } from 'solid-js';

const MyComponent: Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  
  return (
    <div class="container">
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>
        Count: {count()}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### SolidStart Page with Meta Tags
```tsx
import { Title, Meta } from '@solidjs/meta';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Title>QR Scanner - Fast & Secure QR Code Scanner</Title>
      <Meta name="description" content="Scan QR codes and barcodes instantly with our secure mobile app" />
      <Meta property="og:title" content="QR Scanner App" />
      <Meta property="og:description" content="Fast and secure QR code scanning" />
      
      <main>
        {/* Page content */}
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Gradient Background Pattern
```tsx
<div class="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-[#8B5CF6] via-[#D946EF] to-[#7C3AED]">
  <div class="backdrop-blur-xl bg-black/80">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Glassmorphism Card Pattern
```tsx
<div class="backdrop-blur-lg bg-white/10 border border-white/20 rounded-2xl p-6">
  {/* Card content */}
</div>
```
